# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## Chatbot LLM Setup

The chatbot UI now calls the backend `/chatbot` endpoint. By default, the backend uses a small FAQ/local logic. To enable real LLM answers via OpenAI:

- Set environment variables when starting the backend:

  - `OPENAI_API_KEY` â€” your OpenAI API key
  - `OPENAI_MODEL` (optional) â€” defaults to `gpt-4o-mini`

Example (PowerShell):

```
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."; $env:OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-4o-mini"; npm run dev --prefix backend
```

The mobile app uses `API_BASE_URL` in `app/config.ts`. For device testing, change it from `http://localhost:4000` to your machine's LAN IP (e.g. `http://192.168.1.10:4000`).
